## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
### Project Overview: 
In this project, I used Javascript, Plotly, and D3.js to build an interactive dashboard that allows easy exploration and visualization of a dataset of microbes colonizing human belly buttons. 
- The dashboard provides the demographic information of all the study participants. 
- A drop-down menu allows filtering by the subject ID number to show the results for that participant:
  - The top ten bacteria cultures found in the belly button of each participant
  - Belly Button Washing Frequency per Week
  - Bacterial Cultures per Sample
- A popup displays the bacteria's name and frequency when hovering over the charts.

### Results:
